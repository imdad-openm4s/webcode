-> Scope
	ScopeID, CabinetID, PUserID, SName(Halqa, Zone, etc.), Type(Administration, Dawat, Maliyat, Tarbiyat, etc.), Description, Comments

	

-> Kind of resolved
	{(
		-> Roles <-----> Users
			Define roles and assign them to different users.
			Roles:
				Sadar, N.U, M_Committee, D_Committee,
	)}

-> Issues:
	How would I enlist all those meetings/classes in which a specific participant was present/absent?
	What if a new sub-level (Halqa, Zone, etc. are sub-levels) is needed to be added to the system? How would we encounter that?

-> Suggestions
	Replace Scope table with Cabinet_Members table and define different categories like Admin, Dawat, etc. and link that table to "Roles" and "Cabinets" tables. In this way it would be more secure.
	Create another table for setting marakiz for forum, circle, house classes, etc.
